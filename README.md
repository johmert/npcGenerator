## General Information

A simple random stat generator for the popular D&D 5th edition. The "Roll It" Button randomly assigns statistics based on the standard 3d6 dice roll per stat. The "Buy It" Button randomly assigns statistics based more on a method designed to give a "well rounded" level-1 character (a full description of the inspiration can be found on page 13 of 5th Editions Player's Handbook).
